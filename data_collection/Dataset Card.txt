The dataset was collected programmatically using the following reproducible Python code:

```python
import yfinance as yf

nasdaq = yf.download("^IXIC",
                     start="2020-01-01",
                     end="2025-01-01")

nasdaq["return"] = nasdaq["Close"].pct_change()
nasdaq = nasdaq.dropna()

nasdaq.to_csv("nasdaq_dataset.csv")
```

This ensures transparency and full reproducibility for team members and instructors.

## **5. Preprocessing Steps**

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. **Sorting and formatting by date**
2. **Daily return calculation**

   ```python
   nasdaq["return"] = nasdaq["Close"].pct_change()
   ```
